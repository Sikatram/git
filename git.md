# Git and GitHub Introduction

## What is git?

Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

It is used for:
* Tracking code changes
* Tracking who made changes
* Coding collaboration

## What does Git do?
* Manage projects with **Repositories**
* **Clone** a project to work on a local copy
* Control and track chagnes with **Staging** and **Committing**
* **Branch** and **Merge** to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
* **Pull** the latest version of the project to a local copy
* **Push** local updates to the main project

## Working with Git
* Initialize Git on a folder, making it a **Repository**
* Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of change in that folder
* When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered **modified**
* You select the modified files you want to **Stage**
* The **Staged** files are **Committed**, which prompts Git to store a **permanent** snapshot of the files
* Git allows you to see the full history of every commit
* You can revert back to any previous commit
* Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

## Why Git?
* Over 70% of developers use Git
* Developers can work together from anywhere in the world
* Developers can see the full history of the project
* Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project

## What is GitHub?
* Git is not the same as GitHub
* GitHub makes tools that use Git
* gitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018
